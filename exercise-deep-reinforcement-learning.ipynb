The agent wins the game, because all squares without mines are revealed.\n- The agent clears a square that did not contain a hidden mine, but has not yet won or lost the game.\n- The agent detonates a mine and loses the game.\n\nHow might you specify the reward for each of these four cases, so that by maximizing the cumulative reward, the agent will try to win the game?\n\nAfter you have decided on your answer, run the code cell below to get credit for completing this question.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check your answer (Run this code cell to receive credit!)\nq_2.solution()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-27T14:18:52.559090Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-27T14:18:52.559391Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-27T14:18:52.565930Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-27T14:18:52.559367Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-27T14:18:52.565188Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>","application/javascript":"parent.postMessage({\"jupyterEvent\": \"custom.exercise_interaction\", \"data\": {\"interactionType\": 3, \"questionType\": 4, \"questionId\": \"2_DecideReward\", \"learnToolsVersion\": \"0.3.5\", \"valueTowardsCompletion\": 0.0, \"failureMessage\": \"\", \"exceptionClass\": \"\", \"trace\": \"\", \"outcomeType\": 4}}, \"*\")"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Solution: Here's a possible solution - after each move, we give the agent a reward that tells it how well it did:\n- If agent wins the game in that move, it gets a reward of `+1`.\n- Else if the agent selects an invalid move, it gets a reward of `-10`.\n- Else if it detonates a mine, it gets a reward of `-1`.\n- Else if the agent clears a square with no hidden mine, it gets a reward of `+1/100`.\n\nTo check the validity of your answer, note that the reward for selecting an invalid move and for detonating a mine should both be negative.
